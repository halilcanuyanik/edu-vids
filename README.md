# 🎥 Educational Video Sharing Platform

A lightweight web-based application designed to provide a **centralized, user-friendly interface** for accessing internal educational videos within an organization.  
This project was developed during my internship in response to a request from the host institution to create a **more organized and accessible video library** for employees.

## 📌 Project Purpose & Motivation

During my internship, the organization I worked with needed a simple yet effective solution to present educational videos in a **more structured and visually appealing way**.  
Previously, video access relied on **manual folder navigation** or **outdated interfaces**, which often slowed down the learning process.

To address this, I developed a **locally hosted platform** that:
- Categorizes videos for easier navigation.
- Displays them with **thumbnails** and **titles** for better recognition.
- Allows **smooth horizontal scrolling** through video lists.
- Supports **one-click playback** in an embedded player.
- Runs entirely **offline** on the organization's local network.
